    <cbc:Description languageID="ENG">The objective of the procurement is to enter into framework agreement(s) for the delivery of reference standards, Beta-D glukuronidase, calibrators, controls and sample taking equipment used in clinical pharmacology at Bergen Health Trust. The products shall be used in the Section for doctor and drug and alcohol analyses at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Pharmacology (MBF) at Haukeland University Hospital. The section carries out medicine and drug and alcohol analyses in serum, whole blood and urine. There is routine operation, but also some R&amp;D activity. The section has 12 LC-MS/MS-instruments, 2 HPLC- UV instruments and one HS-GC-FID-instrument. In 2024 the division received, among other things, 27,000 serum samples for medicine analyses, 6,500 samples for analyses of immunosuppressants in whole blood and 22,000 urine samples for drug and alcohol analyses. There are currently routine analyses of more than 100 substances and the substance list must be expanded. Based on reference standards, the section produces calibrators and controls for all the drug and alcohol analyses and parts of the medicine analyses. The analysing groups antiepileptics in serum, antidepressants in serum, anti-psychotika in serum, benzodiazepines in serum and immuneuppressants are currently used in full blood commercial calibrators and controls. Helse Bergen wants to continue with this. The analysis group antiepileptics is accredited in accordance with NS-EN ISO 15189: Medical laboratories. The procurement is divided into four sub-contracts: Sub-contract 1: Reference standards and the isotope labels reference standards for quantitative analyses of drug substances and medicinal products in human material (urine, serum, plasma and spit) Sub-contract 2: Beta-D glucuronidase for use in drug and alcohol analyses in human urineDel contract 3: Calibrators and controls for quantitative analysis (TDM) of antidepressants, antipsycotika, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines and immuneuppressants in human materialDel contract 4:  Sample taking equipment for drug and alcohol analyses in spit offers can be given for one, several or all sub-contracts.

Based on reference standards, the section produces calibrators and controls for all the drug and alcohol analyses and parts of the medicine analyses. The analysing groups antiepileptics in serum, antidepressants in serum, anti-psychotika in serum, benzodiazepines in serum and immuneuppressants are currently used in full blood commercial calibrators and controls. Helse Bergen wants to continue with this. The analysis group antiepileptics is accredited in accordance with NS-EN ISO 15189: Medical laboratories. The procurement is divided into four sub-contracts: Sub-contract 1: Reference standards and the isotope labels reference standards for quantitative analyses of drug substances and medicinal products in human material (urine, serum, plasma and spit) Sub-contract 2: Beta-D glucuronidase for use in drug and alcohol analyses in human urineDel contract 3: Calibrators and controls for quantitative analysis (TDM) of antidepressants, antipsycotika, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines and immuneuppressants in human materialDel contract 4:  Sample taking equipment for drug and alcohol analyses in spit offers can be given for one, several or all sub-contracts. The stated consumption/extent is an estimate for information to the tenderer and is not binding for the future contract volume.
