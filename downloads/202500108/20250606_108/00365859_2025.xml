The employment of advisers is an important instrument in implementing ‘The World We Share’ (MFA 2021), Denmark’s strategy for development cooperation as well as the “Africa’s century” (MFA 2024) the strategy for strengthened Danish engagement with African countries.

The Assignment concerns assistance to the MFA with recruitment of sector advisers, who are recruited in close cooperation with Danish authorities and will be posted to Danish embassies, and DANIDA advisers, who are recruited in close cooperation with a national partner in a recipient country and will be working with that partner. Both types of advisers will be directly employed by the MFA. 
The purpose of the Assignment is to ensure efficient and timely recruitment of sector advisers and DANIDA advisers to enable that well-qualified and competent experts are assigned to the MFA’s various activities in developing countries around the world.

The objective of the Assignment is to ensure identification and selection of qualified candidates for vacant posts in a professional and transparent process. 
The task of the Assignment is divided into two main types of Services:
• Assistance in recruiting sector advisers.
• Assistance in recruiting DANIDA advisers.
The Consultant shall handle all practical arrangements related to recruitment of sector advisers and DANIDA advisers. 
The Consultant shall, as part of the Services, ensure good ongoing cooperation with the MFA as well as with the Danish authorities and embassies involved in the individual recruitment processes. While respectively the Multilateral Cooperation office (MULTI) and the Secretariate for the Strategic Sector Cooperation (MYNSEK) together with relevant embassies will be responsible for identification of relevant postings, the recruitment panel (for sector advisers) and recruitment unit (for Danida advisers) will take active part in the recruitment process and subsequent identification of advisers. As there will be many ongoing processes, as well as multiple stakeholders, the Consultant must be able to provide careful, operational, flexible and strategic management of the Services with a strong intercultural understanding. The Consultant must ensure that, as far as possible, there is continuity in the Consultant's staffing from start to finish of a recruitment process.</cbc:Description><cbc:ProcurementTypeCode listName="contract-nature">services</cbc:ProcurementTypeCode><cbc:Note languageID="ENG">In the tender, economic operators must submit a completed and signed statement regarding Article 5k(1) of Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, as amended by Council Regulation (EU) No 2023/1214 of 23 June 2023. The contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer subject to Article 5k(1) of Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014, as amended by Council Regulation (EU) No 2023/1214 of 23 June 2023
Before the contracting authority decides to award the contract, the tenderer, which the contracting authority intends to award the contract to, must present documentation of the information provided in the ESPD.
The contracting authority can accept the following documentation in relation to the exclusion grounds in sections 135(1), 135(3) and 137(1)(2) of the Danish Public Procurement Act (in order of priority):
(1) Extracts from the relevant register or similar documents issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority or certificates issued by the competent authority in the country referred to as documentation that the tenderer is not subject to the grounds for exclusion stipulated in sections 135(1), 135(3) and 137(1)(2);
(2) A declaration on oath (only if such extracts, certificates or similar documents are not issued in the country where the economic operator is established, or where the documentation does not cover all the grounds for exclusion stipulated in sections 135(1), 135(3) and 137(1)(2) entirely);
(3) A solemn declaration made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, a notary or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country where the economic operator is established (only if there is no provision for declarations on oath in the country where the economic operator is established).
Thus, the contracting authority cannot accept e.g. a solemn declaration made before a notary if there can be issued a certificate by the competent authority in the country where the economic operator is established. Moreover, the contracting authority cannot accept self-declarations or similar declarations issued by the economic operator or the person concerned as documentation in relation to the exclusion grounds.
Economic operators can identify the relevant documentation using the online platform e-Certis: https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis
If an economic operator is entered on an official list of approved economic operators or has an equivalent certificate (e.g. under a national (pre)qualification system), the economic operator may refer to the list in question or present a certificate issued by the competent authority instead of documentation of the information provided in the ESPD.
When an economic operator is participating in the procurement procedure together with others, the economic operator must present a joint statement from all the participating economic operators which identifies the member of the group who can act as an agent on behalf of the group with mandate to establish a legal obligation on behalf of the group in relation to the contracting authority.
Economic operators are encouraged to submit all necessary documentation as early as possible.

As there will be many ongoing processes, as well as multiple stakeholders, the Consultant must be able to provide careful, operational, flexible and strategic management of the Services with a strong intercultural understanding. The Consultant must ensure that, as far as possible, there is continuity in the Consultant's staffing from start to finish of a recruitment process.</cbc:Description><cbc:ProcurementTypeCode listName="contract-nature">services</cbc:ProcurementTypeCode><cbc:Note languageID="ENG">In the tender, economic operators must submit a completed and signed statement regarding Article 5k(1) of Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia’s actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, as amended by Council Regulation (EU) No 2023/1214 of 23 June 2023.

Before the contracting authority decides to award the contract, the tenderer, which the contracting authority intends to award the contract to, must present documentation of the information provided in the ESPD.
The contracting authority can accept the following documentation in relation to the exclusion grounds in sections 135(1), 135(3) and 137(1)(2) of the Danish Public Procurement Act (in order of priority):
(1) Extracts from the relevant register or similar documents issued by a competent judicial or administrative authority or certificates issued by the competent authority in the country referred to as documentation that the tenderer is not subject to the grounds for exclusion stipulated in sections 135(1), 135(3) and 137(1)(2);
(2) A declaration on oath (only if such extracts, certificates or similar documents are not issued in the country where the economic operator is established, or where the documentation does not cover all the grounds for exclusion stipulated in sections 135(1), 135(3) and 137(1)(2) entirely);
(3) A solemn declaration made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority, a notary or a competent professional or trade body, in the country of origin or in the country where the economic operator is established (only if there is no provision for declarations on oath in the country where the economic operator is established).

Moreover, the contracting authority cannot accept self-declarations or similar declarations issued by the economic operator or the person concerned as documentation in relation to the exclusion grounds.
