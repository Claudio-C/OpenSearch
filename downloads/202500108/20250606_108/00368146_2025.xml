    <cbc:Description languageID="ENG">Digi Innlandet, c/o the Regional Group for E-Health, shall implement a joint procurement of a new EHR (electronic patient record). HRP AS is assisting Digi Innlandet in implementing the procurement. Digi Innlandet is a digitalisation cooperation between the municipalities in Innlandet county and aims at strengthening the municipalities ́ ability to provide better and more efficient digital services to inhabitants. As the contracting authority, Digi Innlandet represents a broad cooperation across municipal borders and works strategically and operatively with the development, procurement and implementation of joint digital systems. The procurement is being made on behalf of 44 municipalities in Innlandet. The total procurement includes approx. 370,000 inhabitants. The number of inhabitants is only an estimate. The following municipalities are included in the procurement: AlvdalDovreEidskogElverumEngerdalEtnedalFolldalGausdalGjøvikGrueHamarKongsvingerLesjaLillehammerLomLøtenNord-AurdalNord-FronNord-OdalNordre LandRendalenRingebuRingsakerSelSkjåkStangeStor-ElvdalSøndre LandSør-AurdalSør-OdalTolgaTrysilTynsetVangVestre SlidreVestre TotenVågVålerØstre TotenØyerØystre SlidreÅmotÅsnesKommuner on option: GranInnlandets municipalities need a new and modern electronic patient journal system (EPJ). to strengthen the quality and create more sustainable health and care services. The procurement is an element in the digitalisation of the services that is based on the need for increased functionality, security and better interaction between different units and services. An updated EPJ system is essential for health personnel to quickly get access to the right information, which is absolutely necessary for providing good patient treatment, ensuring good quality, supporting good and seamless task flow and ensuring safe and good follow-up of inhabitants. The contract ́s total value over a 3 year period is estimated to be in an interval between NOK 200 - 300 million, excluding VAT. The estimate is naturally encumbered with great uncertainty due to, among other things, the content, scope and costs connected to the final EPJ system that is included in the contract. A contract shall be signed with one tenderer for the assignment. The contract will be an ongoing contract with an initial contract period of 3 years, with an automatic extension for 1 year at a time.
